# Blackjack Console Game

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python. It's one of my first game projects.

As a beginner project, the game is intended to explore the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the use of classes in Python.

## How to Play

The game starts by asking the player to enter their name. It then uses a standard deck of cards and randomly deals cards to the player and the dealer. The player's goal is to get a higher score than the dealer, without going over 21.

During the game, the player is prompted to hit or stand. If the player hits, another card is dealt and added to their hand. If the player stands, the dealer will then draw cards until their score is at least 17.

The game ends when the player decides to stand or when their score goes over 21. The dealer then draws cards until their score is 17 or higher. The game then determines the winner based on the scores.

## How to Run

To run the game, simply run the `blackjack_game.py` file. The code will prompt the player to enter their name and start the game.

## Notes

As a first project, this implementation of Blackjack is intentionally simple and only covers basic gameplay mechanics. There may be improvements or additional features that can be added, such as adding betting or more complex strategies.

Overall, this project is intended to be a fun and educational way to explore the basics of OOP and Python programming.
